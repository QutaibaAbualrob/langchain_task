COHERE_API_KEY:
    I hard codded the API key for practical reasons
        as its not the best practice to hard code api keys

            for security reasons and by making the code flexiable
                    but not relying on manual edit
                    instead enviorment variables


Database choices:

    Tables:

        Eference Tables (Ref_*) act as lookup tables for statuses and types

        Customer Management: Handles customer details and their preferred payment methods.

        Product Catalog: Products are categorized by types, which can be hierarchical 
        (self-referencing Ref_Product_Types).

        Order Processing: Tracks orders, their specific items, 
        and the status of each item independently.

        Billing & Shipping: Separates Invoices, Payments,
        and Shipments into distinct entities, allowing for partial shipments or complex billing cycles.

    Migrations:

        using alembic module
        
            alembic revision --autogenerate
                (python manage.py makemigrations)
        
            alembic upgrade head 
                (python manage.py migrate) 


        Steps:

            alembic init alembic

                creates an alembic.ini file and an alembic/ directory.

            Configure Database URL

                Open the alembic.ini file created in your root directory.
                Find the line starting with sqlalchemy.url and set it to your database connection string.

            Connect Your Schema (env.py)
            
                tell Alembic where your Base models are so it can detect them
